New BSC Token Tracker
=====

Script for discovering new BSC tokens once they appear in CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listings. It runs in terminal continuously and plays alert sound if list changes ! Tested on Linux only.

Both public APIs do not provide direct way for accessing newly listed tokens, so have to rely on webscraping a lot. However script makes the job done.
